# wsjtz-AppImage
AppImage of WSJT-Z â€“ fork of WSJT-X with automation features.

Produced AppImage should work like a charm, but there is no guarantee.  
WSJTZ (and WSJTX) are surprisingly hard to pack into AppImage with all(!) dependencies.  
Tests have shown that I have provided enough libs for any real desktop, but feel free to lead me out of that error!

## Install
Just download and run the AppImage.

## Build
Clone the repo and:  
`docker-compose build; docker-compose up`  
You will get the AppImage in the `./release/` directory.  

## WSJTZ source
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt-z/  
Since sf is IMHO less reliable than GitHub, I've created backup of the wsjtz source, that I've used to build AppImage. Just in case.  
It is located in the `./src/` directory and can be used to build AppImage pretty easy (Dockerfile is prepared for such source switch).

## Versioning
For simplicity, I'm going to stick to the wsjtz version number.

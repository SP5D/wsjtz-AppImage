# wsjtz-AppImage
AppImage of WSJT-Z â€“ fork of WSJT-X with automation features.

Produced AppImage should work like a charm, but there is no guarantee.  
WSJTZ (and WSJTX) are surprisingly hard to pack into AppImage with all(!) dependencies.  
Tests have shown that I have provided enough libs for any real desktop, but feel free to lead me out of that error!

## Install
Just download and run the AppImage.
### Arch Linux
This AppImage is available in AUR repository as ```wsjtz-appimage```.  
You can use your favorite helper, e.g.:  
```paru -S wsjtz-appimage```
### Linux (in general)
The simplest way is just:  
```
wget https://github.com/SP5D/wsjtz-AppImage/releases/download/v2.5.4-1.22/wsjtz-x86_64.AppImage -O /usr/bin/wsjtz-appimage
chmod 755 /usr/bin/wsjtz-appimage
```

## Build
Clone the repo and:  
`docker-compose build; docker-compose up`  
You will get the AppImage in the `./release/` directory.  

## WSJTZ source
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt-z/  
Since sf is IMHO less reliable than GitHub, I've created backup of the wsjtz source, that I've used to build AppImage. Just in case.  
It is located in the `./src/` directory and can be used to build AppImage pretty easy (Dockerfile is prepared for such source switch).

## Versioning
For simplicity, I'm going to stick to the wsjtz version number.
